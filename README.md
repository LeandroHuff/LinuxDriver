#Linux Driver

This project is a very small source code to show the minimum code need to implement a linux driver. The purpose is to teach how to create and run a linux driver. I developed and run it in a Ubuntu 20.xx operating system running at a notebook Dell. Many times I asked myself about how to create one linux driver and what are the needs to do that, along of researches, read a log of internet information and study specific material about drivers and linux, I'd like to share these informations with everyone and make it usefully for anyone that want to start a linux driver development. A lot of skills was added along this work, from the dark to the light, it is the sensation after running the first linux driver and see the messages in the linux log files.
